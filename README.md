[![Min Dark Theme - JetBrains Marketplace Library Cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eef5fc6-7bdd-4977-b0ca-26e4a28cf42c)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28805-min-dark-theme/)

A minimalist and elegant dark theme for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs, ported from the popular [Min Theme for VS Code](https://github.com/miguelsolorio/min-theme) by [Miguel Solorio](https://github.com/miguelsolorio).

Min Dark Theme focuses on clarity, soft contrast, and a clean design for a comfortable and productive coding experience.

## ✨ Features

* **Minimalist Design:** Distraction-free UI and editor.
* **Soft Contrast:** Carefully selected colors for easy reading and reduced eye strain.
* **Readability Focus:** Clear syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
* **Wide Compatibility:** Works with IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, PhpStorm, RubyMine, GoLand, DataGrip, CLion, and more.

## 🚀 Installation

### Via JetBrains Marketplace

1.  Open your JetBrains IDE.
2.  Go to `Settings/Preferences (Ctrl+Alt+S or Cmd+,)`
3.  Navigate to `Plugins`.
4.  Click the `Marketplace` tab.
5.  Search for "Min Dark Theme".
6.  Click `Install`.
7.  Restart the IDE when prompted.

After installation, go to `Settings/Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > Appearance` and select "Min Dark Theme" from the `Theme` dropdown.

## ⚙️ Adjusting the Color Scheme

This theme includes both a **UI Theme** (interface colors) and a **Color Scheme** (code editor colors). IntelliJ should apply them together, but if your code editor doesn't change:

1.  Go to `Settings/Preferences > Editor > Color Scheme`.
2.  In the `Scheme` dropdown, select **"Min Dark Theme"**.
3.  Click `Apply` or `OK`.
